# Win a car

Win a car is a simple 3 select card game with the goal of matching 3 cards to win a shiny new car!

To get started you just need to hit the start button and start selecting cards. Once you select 3 cards if you don't get a match hit try again. You only get 5 attempts per go!

Once 5 attempts as been made, a game over screen will pop up and you can hit restart to try again. One you match 3 cards a pop up will appear containing a form asking for your name and email address, once this is filled in and submitted you will receive an email confirming your prize.

Win a car also has a dark mode toggle for the keen dark mode enthusiasts out there!

## User Experience (UX)

There is a clear navigation in the nav bar which directs you on where to join the league or sign up to competitions. It directs you to a tournaments gallery Where pictures of tournaments others have competed in can be viewed.

The website is a simple single page that makes use of modals instead of diverting to other pages. When selecting the modals users can either check the rules, submit a query/complaint and enter their email details should they win the game.

Users can also switch between light and dark mode by selecting the moon logo on the top right corner. 

To make the user experience easy - I wanted the site to have:

* A simple call to action in the form of the "Play!" button which also turns to a "Next Turn" button after the 1st attempts are made.
* A simple UI. I wanted minimal buttons appearing on the screen to make it less cluttered focussing only on what they need to play the game or ask any questions.
* Fast game that's responsive to user actions.

## User Stories
To determine which approach to take with site features I detirmined the goals of different users from first time through to frequent users.
