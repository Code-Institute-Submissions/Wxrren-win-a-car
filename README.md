# Win a car

Win a car is a simple 3 select card game with the goal of matching 3 cards to win a shiny new car!

To get started you just need to hit the start button and start selecting cards. Once you select 3 cards if you don't get a match hit try again. You only get 5 attempts per go!

Once 5 attempts as been made, a game over screen will pop up and you can hit restart to try again. One you match 3 cards a pop up will appear containing a form asking for your name and email address, once this is filled in and submitted you will receive an email confirming your prize.

Win a car also has a dark mode toggle for the keen dark mode enthusiasts out there!
